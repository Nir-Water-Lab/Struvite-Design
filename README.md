### Struvite Program Installation Instruction
1. Download and install the ‘Anaconda Python distribution’ from: 
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Download and install the two ‘IPhreeqc Modules’ from (circled in red below): 
https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/

3. Unzip the content of ‘Struvite Model’ to a chosen folder.
4. You are ready to go. Launch the Python editor **‘Spyder’** and run the model using either 
the Graphic User Interface (struvite_GUI31) or the Struvite_main4 IDLE interface.

The **‘Struvite Process Design and Operation’** Tool was developed at the Technion - Israel 
Institute of Technology, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering. 

It is now updated and maintained by Dr. Oded Nir, Senior Lecturer at the Zuckerberg 
Institute for Water Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
